<h1>SWordMap: Learning Semantically Related Words in Software through Word Embedding</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>We publish our identified semantic related words in order for any scientific work of other people.</p>
<h2>Experiments</h2>
<h3>RQ1: How accurate are the semantically related words produced by SWordMap?</h3>
<p>This RQ is to evaluate the accuracy of the identified semantically related words. We randomly sample 100 words from the results produced by SWordMap, and manually verify if the semantically related words of each sampled word are truly relevant. The accuracy is measured as the average number of correct semantic related words in the top 10 returned results (i.e., Precision@10).<br/>
We also check how many correct results cannot be found in WordNet or a dictionary and further classify them into 6 categories: <i>synonym</i>, <i>related</i>, <i>antonym</i>, <i>abbreviation</i>, <i>morphology</i>, <i>spelling</i>.</p>
<h3>RQ2: Can identified semantically related words improve concern location?</h3>
<p>This RQ evaluates if SWordMap can improve the accuracy of concern location. To answer this RQ, we perform the same concern location queries as related work used, on the same  open source Java projects (as shown in Table~2).<br/>
We use the same regular expressions as Yang et al. did to search for functions that are related to a concern. For each query, we expand it with its semantically related words and construct the regular expressions (we use the top 40 most relevant words in our experiments). We also compare our results with the results obtained by SWordNet.</p>
<h3>RQ3: Can identified semantically related words improve local code search?</h3>
<p>This RQ evaluates whether the results of SWordMap can improve the accuracy of local search of functions. To answer the RQ, we design 25 function search queries for the four Java projects shown in Table~2. For each query, we manually create the "round truth" y reading the project source code and selecting the directly related functions that match the query. To evaluate SWordMap, we expand the queries with the semantically related words produced by SWordMap using a simple Boolean model. That is, we build the Boolean clause of a word by automatically adding all its semantic related words using OR logic, and then concatenate all the sub-clauses by AND logic. For a user query, we first remove all its stop words. We then expand the query using the Boolean model and use it as the input to the code search tool.<br/>
To compare with the SWordNet approach, we also expand the same queries with the semantically related words produced by SWordNet (including its transitive version SWordNet-T). For each query, we manually check the correctness of the search results and compute the Recall/Precision values based on the ground truth.
